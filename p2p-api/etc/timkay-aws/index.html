<p>
aws is a command-line tool that gives you easy access to Amazon EC2
and Amazon S3.  aws is designed to be simple to install and simple to
use.
<p>
Thanks to your feedback (<a href=timkay@not.com>timkay@not.com</a>), aws is the top-rated "community code"
for all of Amazon EC2 and S3!  See the ratings and reviews at
<a href=http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=739&categoryID=85>EC2</a> and
<a href=http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=739&categoryID=47>S3</a>.  They make me blush!  Thank you!
<p>
This document describes the basic features.  For additional examples, see the <a href=howto.html>HowTo document</a>.

<h3>Download</h3>

This section describes how to install aws on Linux and other *ix systems.  To install on Windows, see <a href=#windows>Windows Download and Configuration</a>.

aws has only one dependency (curl), in addition to perl, which is often pre-installed on Linux.
<p>
To use aws, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Install <tt>curl</tt> if necessary (either <tt>apt-get install curl</tt> or <tt>yum install curl</tt>)
<li>Download <a href=http://github.com/timkay/aws>aws</a> to your computer <blockquote><tt>curl
timkay.com/aws/aws -o aws</tt></blockquote></li>
<li><i>OPTIONAL</i>.  Perform this step if you want to use commands like <code>s3ls</code> and <code>ec2run</code>.  If you prefer commands like <code>aws ls</code> or <code>aws run</code>, then you may skip this step.  Just make sure to set "aws" to be executable:  "<code>chmod +x aws</code>".
<p>
Perform the optional install it with
<blockquote><tt>perl aws --install</tt></blockquote>
(This step sets <tt>aws</tt> to be executable, copies it
to /usr/bin if you are root, and then symlinks the aliases, the same as
<tt>aws --link</tt> does.)</li>
<p>
<li>Put your AWS credentials in <tt>~/.awssecret</tt>:  the Access Key
ID on the first line and the Secret Access Key on the second line.  Example:  <blockquote><tt>1B5JYHPQCXW13GWKHAG2<br>2GAHKWG3+1wxcqyhpj5b1Ggqc0TIxj21DKkidjfz</tt></blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p>
If you are logged in as root, aws will be installed in /usr/bin.
Otherwise, it will be installed in the current directory.
<p>
You are ready to use Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3.  Try the following
example.  You'll need to provide your own BUCKET_NAME, unique from
all other bucket names.
<blockquote><pre><tt>s3mkdir BUCKET_NAME
s3put BUCKET_NAME/aws-backup /usr/bin/aws
s3ls BUCKET_NAME
s3get BUCKET_NAME/aws-backup
s3delete BUCKET_NAME/aws-backup
s3delete BUCKET_NAME

ec2run
ec2din
ec2tin INSTANCEID
</tt></pre></blockquote>
<p>
As a security measure, make sure that ~/.awssecret is not readable by group or other (<tt>chmod -go ~/.awssecret</tt>).

<a name=windows></a>
<h3>Windows Download and Configuration</h3>

As of <code>v1.10</code>, aws runs on Windows.  Currently, client authentication
isn't supported, until I figure out where to put the cert.  (Hence the
--insecure-aws setting.)
<p>
To download and configure, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Install <tt>curl</tt>.  Search for "curl download".  The first
result should be <a
href=http://curl.haxx.se/download.html>http://curl.haxx.se/download.html</a>.
In the "Win32 Generic" section, choose the "Win32" binary with SSL.
The download is a .zip file.  Extract curl.exe and place in the
C:\Windows directory, or some other place that is in the path.  Test
by opening a cmd window, then do "cd \" and "curl".  It should find
curl.</li>
<li>Download ActivePerl from <a href=http://www.activestate.com/store/download.aspx?prdGUID=81fbce82-6bd5-49bc-a915-08d58c2648ca>ActiveState</a>.</li>
<li>Download the latest <a href=http://github.com/timkay/aws>aws</a> to C:\Windows or your current directory, and rename to aws.pl.</li>
<li>Put your AWS credentials in C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;YOUR
NAME&gt;\.awssecret (see the example file in the above Download section).</li>
<li>Try <tt>aws.pl --insecure-aws ls</tt> -- you should get a list of
your S3 buckets.</li>
</ol>

To run on Windows, you need to use the --insecure-aws flag, unless you
figure out where to install the certificate that comes with Curl for
Windows.
<p>
The following command will list your S3 buckets:

<blockquote><xmp>aws.pl --insecure-aws ls</xmp></blockquote>

If you prefer to use environment variables to set the secrets rather
than the .awssecret file, you can create this batch file, replacing
XXX with your keys, of course:

<blockquote><xmp>set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX
set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXX
aws.pl --insecure-aws %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9</xmp></blockquote>

<h3>Overview</h3>

Do you want to use Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 but are intimidated
by how difficult they are to use?  Do you find it cumbersome (and ironic) that a web service requires you to install Java?  If so, aws is for you.
<p>
aws is a very simple, light weight interface to Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3, that implements basic commands like <tt>ec2run</tt> and <tt>s3ls</tt>.
<p>
The command-line interface works like this:
<p>
<blockquote><tt>aws ACTION [PARAMETERS]</tt></blockquote>
<p>
For example, you can start an EC3 server instance:
<p>
<blockquote>aws run</blockquote>
<p>
Or, you can store a file named <tt>file7.txt</tt> to S3 in bucket
<tt>mybucket</tt>, object <tt>sample.txt</tt>:
<p>
<blockquote><tt>aws put mybucket/sample.txt file7.txt</tt></blockquote>
<p>
If you like, you can have aws create command-line aliases, such as
<tt>ec2run</tt> and <tt>s3put</tt>, so that you don't have to prepend
"aws" to each command.  aws can create its own aliases as follows.
This step was done for you if you installed with --install.
<blockquote><tt>aws --link</tt></blockquote>
<p>
Then you can perform the operations without the "aws" prefix:
<blockquote><tt>ec2run</tt><br><tt>s3put mybucket/sample.txt file7.txt</tt></blockquote>

<h3>~/.awssecret File Format</h3>

aws needs access to a pair of strings called the Access Key ID and the
Secret Access Key.  By default, aws looks for these secrets in a file
~/.awssecret, but a different file can be specified using --secrets-file=FILE.  The secrets are stored in this file separated by white space, as in the
following example:
<blockquote><tt>1B5JYHPQCXW13GWKHAG2<br>2GAHKWG3+1wxcqyhpj5b1Ggqc0TIxj21DKkidjfz</tt></blockquote>
<p>
Keep in mind that your Secret Access Key must be kept secret; anybody
with access to that key gets full access to your EC2 and S3 instances
and files.  If your file permissions are too generous, a warning is generated.
<p>
You may use environment variables to specify the secrets rather than
the .awssecret file.  For example,

<blockquote><xmp>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXX aws ls</xmp></blockquote>

Use of environment variables is not recommended because command lines and environment variables are visible to other users of the same host.
<p>
It is possible to configure aws to use a remote signing service (see
below), enabling your infrastructure to make use of the Secret Access
Key without having access to it.

<h3>~/.awsrc File Format</h3>

The ~/.awsrc file may contain command-line parameters in the same format that they would appear on the command line, on one line or several.  For example, the following ~/.awsrc file
sets the --insecure-aws option, so that host authentication is turned off.  (Useful if your host certificates don't work.)  It also sets the --simple option, so that "aws ls" commands generate output that is simple to parse.

<blockquote><pre>--insecure-aws
--simple
</pre></blockquote>

The existence of the ~/.awsrc file (even if empty) turns off default sanity checking.  To enable sanity checking when ~/.awsrc exists, add <code>--sanity-check</code> to the ~/.awsrc file.

<h3>Sanity Checking</h3>

When it starts, "aws" checks for Certain common conditions that prevent it from working properly:
<p>
<table bgcolor=black cellpadding=4 cellspacing=1>
<tr bgcolor=white>
<td>~/.awssecret is missing
<br>~/.awssecret not readable
<br><nobr>~/.awssecret has wrong permissions &nbsp;</nobr>
</td><td>You must create a .awssecret file that contains the access keys for your AWS account.</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=white><td><nobr>local host certificates aren't working</nobr></td><td>The curl command is used to access Amazon Web Services.  The connection is secured via TLS (also called SSL or https).  If your host certificates aren't set properly, the TLS connection fails.  Fix the problem or add --insecure-aws to ~/.awsrc.</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=white><td>AWS is not reachable</td><td>For some reason, curl could not access <a href=https://s3.amazonaws.com/>https://s3.amazonaws.com/</a></td></tr>
<tr bgcolor=white><td>local host time is wrong</td><td>If your host's clock is set wrong, then requests might be signed with an invalid timestamp.  The sanity check code will automatically correct for a wrong host clock.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
For optimal performance, sanity checks should be disabled by creating
a ~/.awsrc file.  If you have reason to create .awsrc and still
want sanity checks enabled, add <code><nobr>--sanity-check</nobr></code> to
~/.awsrc.  If you want the sanity checks enabled (perhaps to correct for a wrong host
clock), but you want to disable warnings, add
<code>--sanity-check</code> and <code><nobr>--silent</nobr></code> to ~/.awsrc.
<p>
Sanity check warnings will not be displayed if stdin is set to something other than a tty.  Thus, you might not see sanity check warnings when invoking "aws" from within a script.

<p>
Use <code>--progress</code> to display progress for large S3 transfers.
<p>
<font color=red>New!</font>
<b><code>aws put</code> using STDIN</b>
<p>
When using <code>aws put</code> with no source file, or if the source file is <code>-</code>, then a temporary file is created, stdin is copied into the temporary file, and that file is uploaded.  For example,
<blockquote><code>echo hello, world |aws put test681/hello.txt</code></blockquote>
creates an object named <code>test681/hello.txt</code>, which contains <code>hello, world\n</code>.
<p>
The MIME type is set as appropriate for the target file name.
<p>
<b>Using "get" with a Directory Target</b>
<p>
If the target of a "get" operation ends with "/", or if the target is a directory, then the file name will be taken from the object name.  Examples:
<p>
<blockquote style="font: normal 8pt monospace">
aws get timkay/aws-1.12 .
</blockquote>
will retrieve the object and store it as "aws-1.12" in the current directory.
<p>
<blockquote style="font: normal 8pt monospace">
aws get timkay/aws-1.12 x/y/z/
</blockquote>
will retrieve the object and store it as "x/y/z/aws-1.12", relative to the current directory.  As necessary, it will create directories.  Compare to
<p>
<blockquote style="font: normal 8pt monospace">
aws get timkay/aws-1.12 x/y/z
</blockquote>
which will retrieve the object and store it as "x/y/z", assuming "x/y/z" isn't already a directory.  (The file is named "z" in the subdirectory "x/y/".)
<p>
Note that it is possible to use slashes in object names, such as "x/y/foo".  It would be useful to say
<p>
<blockquote style="font: normal 8pt monospace">
aws get timkay/x/y/foo .
</blockquote>
to retrieve the object and store as x/y/foo.  The current implementation will
store it as file "foo" in the current directory, discarding the object's "path".  It's
not clear which action is the right one.  If you have an opinion, please
send feedback.
<p>
<b>Specifying <code>x-amz-*:</code> and <code>Content-Type:</code> Headers</b>
<p>
It is possible to send <code>x-amz-*:</code> and <code>Content-Type:</code> headers by including them on the <code>aws</code> command line after the verb.  The following example sets the object access policies to be world-readable and also sets the content type as appropriate for a .jpg file:
<blockquote style="font: normal 8pt monospace">
aws put "x-amz-acl: public-read" "Content-Type: image/jpg" timkay681 tim.jpg
</blockquote>
<p>
As of <code>v1.12</code>, if it isn't set otherwise, the
<code>Content-Type:</code> header is automatically set using the
<code>mime.types</code> file, which is read from both the current
directory and /etc/, if they exist.
<p>
<b>Changing the ACL of an Existing Object</b>
<font color=red>New!</font>
<p>
To change the ACL of an object to a canned access policy, store an empty ACL file and include a header to indicate the desired canned access policy:
<blockquote><code>aws put "x-amz-acl: public-read" test681/tim2.jpg?acl /dev/null</code></blockquote>
The <code>--set-acl</code> option does the same thing with a simpler syntax:
<blockquote><code>aws put test681/tim2.jpg?acl --set-acl=public-read</code></blockquote>
or even
<blockquote><code>aws put test681/tim2.jpg?acl --public</code></blockquote>
<p>
The choices for --set-acl are <code>private</code>, <code>public-read</code>, <code>public-read-write</code>, and <code>authenticated-read</code>. 
As of <code>aws-1.25</code>, <code>--public</code> is equivalent to <code>--set-acl=public-read</code>, and <code>--private</code> is equivalent to <code>--set-acl=private</code>.
<p>
For more information about canned access policies, see the <a
href=http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/index.html?RESTAccessPolicy.html>Amazon S3
API</a>.  To control the ACL more precisely, see the following section, Setting Access Policies (ACLs).
<p>
<b>Setting Access Policies (ACLs)</b>
<p>
You can set canned access policies as described in the previous section.
Otherwise, setting access policies requires that you create an XML file
containing the access policies.  You might start by retrieving the
existing policies, modify those policies, then upload the changes, as
shown in the example below.  You can see that <a
href=http://public681.s3.amazonaws.com/tim.jpg>the results</a> are
publicly readable.

For more information about about setting access policies, see the
Amazon S3 documentation: "<a
href=http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/RESTAccessPolicy.html>Setting

<p>
Note that some browsers cache the content types of URLs.  If you
browse a URL then change it's content type, then hit refresh, the
broswer might not notice the new content type.  To fix this problem,
you should flush the content cache.  (With FireFox, use Tools/Clear
Private Data with the "Cache" option checked.)
<p>
<b>Sending &lt;CreateBucketConfiguration&gt; Data with "mkdir"</b>
<p>
"put" and "mkdir" used to be the same code (you could create buckets with either).  To support configuration options, they
are now different.  If you don't care about the Location of a bucket, then you can continue to use
either.  However, if you want to specify Location, then you have to use "mkdir".  ("<tt>aws mkdir foo eu.xml</tt>" and "<tt>aws put foo eu.xml</tt>" do two different things: The first sets the configuration of the new bucket <tt>foo</tt> as per the file <tt>eu.xml</tt>, while the latter stores the file <tt>eu.xml</tt> in bucket <tt>foo</tt>.)
<ol>
<li>Create a file with the &lt;CreateBucketConfiguration&gt; XML tag in it.  See <a href=eu.xml>eu.xml</a> as an example.</li>
<li>Create the bucket with
<blockquote style="font: normal 8pt monospace">
aws mkdir BUCKETNAME CONFIGURATIONFILE
</blockquote>
For example, you could say
<blockquote style="font: normal 8pt monospace">
aws mkdir my-new-bucket eu.xml
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>To see the Location constraint of a bucket, use the ?location attribute:
<blockquote style="font: normal 8pt monospace">
aws get BUCKETNAME?location
</blockquote>
For example, you could say
<blockquote style="font: normal 8pt monospace">
aws --xml get my-new-bucket?location |xmlpp
</blockquote>
returns
<blockquote style="font: normal 8pt monospace"><xmp><?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<LocationConstraint xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">EU</LocationConstraint>
</xmp></blockquote>
Notes: I am using the --xml output format, until I get xml2tab working in this case.  <code>xmlpp</code> is at <a href=/xmlpp/>http://timkay.com/xmlpp/</a>
</li>
</ol>
Remember that buckets naming is more strict when specifying Location constraints.  See the Amazon S3 documentation:
"<a href=http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/index.html?BucketConfiguration.html>Bucket Restrictions and Limitations</a>".
<p>

<h3>EC2 Reference Guide</h3>

The EC2 interface supports the same command line options as Amazon's
java implementation.  See the Amazon EC2 documentation:
"<a href=http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/DeveloperGuide/CLTRG-by-function.html>List of Operations by Function</a>" for details.
<p>
Use "aws COMMAND -h" to see the options available for each command.  For example,
<blockquote style="font: normal 8pt monospace">
$ ./aws run -h
<br>$ ./aws run -h
Usage: aws run-instance run [ImageId (ami-23b6534a)] [-i InstanceType (ml.small)] [-a AddressingType (public)] [-n MinCount (1)] [-n MaxCount (1)] [-g SecurityGroup... (default)] [-k KeyName (default)] [-d UserData] [-f UserData]
</blockquote>
Here we see that the <code>run-instance</code> command takes an image id, an instance type, an addressing type, a count of servers, security groups, a key name, and user data.  The defaults are specified in parentheses.
<p>
<blockquote>
Note. The following command groups are now supported, but the following table has not been updated.  The syntax is the same as Amazon's command-line tools.
<ul>
<li>registering images</li>
<li>availability zones</li>
<li>kernel types</li>
<li>persistent IP addresses</li>
</ul>

<font color=red>New!</font> <b>--wait=SEC</b>
<p>
As of <code>aws-1.24</code>, the <code>--wait=SEC</code> switch tells <code>ec2run</code> to poll for the status of the new instances (using ec2-describe-instances), waiting for them to leave "pending" status (presumably entering "running" status).  Waits SEC seconds between polling attempts.
<blockquote><xmp>$ ./aws-1.24 run -k k2 --wait=10
i-97f276fe      pending
i-97f276fe      pending
i-97f276fe      pending
i-97f276fe      pending
i-97f276fe      pending
i-97f276fe      running ec2-75-101-242-20.compute-1.amazonaws.com</xmp></blockquote>
<p>
<b>Regions</b>
<p>
Use <code>--region=eu-west-1</code> to
select the European EC2 region.  <code>eu</code> and <code>us</code>
are synonums for <code>eu-west-1</code> and <code>us-east-1</code>.
<p>
Add <code>--region=eu</code> to <code>~/.awsrc</code> to switch the default region.
<p>
<h3>Robustness and Scripting</h3>

To interact with EC2 and S3 services, "aws" delegates the core
functionality to the command line program "curl", which has many
features and options.  Some of the options are made explicitely
available via "aws" command line options.  Other curl command line
options may be set using the --curl-options="..." setting.
<p>
To improve the likelihood that a transaction succeeds succeeds, "aws"
sets the appropriate curl option, so that all failed transactions are
retried up to 3 times.
<p>
The "aws" command --max-time=N indicates the maximum number of seconds
to allow a given try to succeed.  If the timeout is exceeded, it is
terminated and retried up to 3 times.  (By default, there is no
timeout, so a transaction can potentially hang forever.)
<p>
As of <code>v1.28</code>, the --md5 option
computes the MD5 checksum for all objects and generates an error when
a mismatch occurs.
<p>
Also as of <code>v1.28</code>, $? is set
correctly in most cases, so that scripts can tell if an "aws"
transaction completes successfully.
<p>
<h3>Remote Signature Mode</h3>

A user gets only one Secret Access Key.  It should be kept secret, but
it is needed to sign requests.  Thus, any EC2 instances that need to pull
data from S3 need to have access to the secret.
<p>
It's not always a good idea to store your key on any server that needs
access to Amazon Web Services.
<p>
So how does an EC2 instance access S3 data without using the Secret
Access Key?  By using aws in remote signature mode.  Remote signature
mode is a web service that signs EC2 and S3 requests remotely.  The
Secret Access Key is stored only on the server(s) that provide the
signing service.
<p>
aws can then run on an EC2 instance, performing all operations as it
normally would, except that it signs its requests using a remote call
to the web service.
<p>
The web service can be protected with a password, by restricting
access to known IP addresses, and/or by limiting what requests are
allowed.
<p>
To use remote signature mode, two things have to happen.  First, the
web service needs to be configured by following these steps on the
server that is to host it.
<p>
<ol>

<li>Make sure that aws runs properly at the command line when logged
in as the user that apache runs as.  (Log in as www-data, and do
<tt>aws ls</tt>, for example, to see that aws and ~/.awssecret are
properly configured.</li>

<li>Create a CGI that contains just this one line:<blockquote><xmp>#!/usr/bin/env aws</xmp></blockquote> and configure the
web server, so that the script is password (or otherwise) protected
and executable.  It is also a good idea to use SSL (https) to access this service, so that the password is encrypted.  To use a self-signed certificate, see the --insecure-signing setting.
<p>
The following PHP code implements a remote signing service:<blockquote><xmp><?
  list($head, $body) = explode("\n\n", shell_exec("aws --sign=" . file_get_contents("php://input")));
  header("Content-type: text/plain");
  echo $body;
?></xmp></blockquote>Make sure that aws is in the web server's path, or else add the explicit path (probably /usr/bin/aws) to the script.
</li>

<li>Test this remote signing service by pointing your browser to the
URL.  It should display something like
<blockquote><tt>VKL5xvaVRCTAsBTF63dCr5zc3I4=</tt>.</blockquote>(This
particular string is the empty string, signed by my Secret Access
Key.)
</li>

</ol>

You now have a aws remote signing service.
<p>
Next, you need to configure the client to use the remote signing
service:

<ol>

<li>Create ~/.awssecret like
this:<blockquote><tt>_<br>_<br>https://user:pass@timkay.com/aws/sign/</tt></blockquote>The
first line two lines contains underscore ("_") characters where your
Access Key ID and Secret Access Key would normally go.  The third line
contains the URL of the signing service.  If the service is password
protected, the URL should contain the username and password, as
indicated.</li>

<li>Test the remote signing by running "<tt>aws -v ls</tt>".  You should
see a message like this, followed by the output from the "ls" command.
<blockquote><tt>signing [GET\n\n\n1172520135\n/] via https://******:******@timkay.com/aws/sign/</tt></blockquote>

</ol>

Be careful securing your remote signing service: if you use HTTP Basic
Authentication, then your password is sent in clear text and can be
sniffed.  You'll create a situation where your AWS credentials are
secure but can still be used by an unauthorized 3rd party.  To
mitigate the risk, you can use basic authentication combined with SSL
by specifying a https URL (instead of http) in the ~/.awssecret file.
The URL format is https://USER:PASS@www.DOMAIN.com/ETC/.  The server
hosting your signing service then needs to be configured to support
SSL.  If you use a self-signed certificate, remote signing will still fail
because the server cannot be properly authenticated (due to the self-signed nature of the certificate).  The --insecure-signing option
tells aws to ignore this particular error.  Using https with
--insecure-signing is better than simply using http because the connection is
encrypted, which prevents the basic authentication password from being
sniffed.


<h3>Changes</h3>

See <a href=Changes.txt>Changes.txt</a>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

aws is written in pure perl.  It consists of a single
file (roughly 1,500 lines).  The core functions are ec2() and
s3(), which are about 25 and 150 lines.
<p>
The rest of the program contains the command-line interface, the
pretty-printer, and HMAC and SHA1 code, none of which is needed when
calling ec2() or s3() from your program.  In that case, use
Digest::SHA1 (or Digest::SHA1::PurePerl) and parse the XML however you
like.  (I have no idea if ec2() and s3() can be run in isolation any more.)

<a name=s3_dir>
<h3>export S3_DIR=bucket</h3>

If you work primarily with a single bucket, you can
<blockquote><tt>export S3_DIR=bucket</tt></blockquote>
aws will prepend bucket/ to any name you specify in any command.
<p>
Thus, you can do the following sorts of operations:
<blockquote><pre><tt>
export S3_DIR=timkay
s3put foo		# put file foo to object timkay/foo
s3ls			# list objects in bucket timkay
s3cat foo		# display object timkay/foo
s3rm foo		# remove object timkay/foo
</pre></tt></blockquote>

To deactivate S3_DIR, use
<blockquote><tt>export -n S3_DIR</tt></blockquote>

<a name=bugs>
<h3>Bugs</h3>

aws does not yet support ec2 Images and Image Attributes functionality, only because I have no need for them.  Everything else is there.
<p>
Occasionally, system certificates are misconfigured, so that SSL to
Amazon fails at the server authentication step.  (Note that this is a
different problem than when using self-signed certificates for remote
signing mode.)  The option --insecure-aws tells aws to continue anyway.
If aws isn't working, you can test for this problem with
<blockquote>
<xmp>curl -vv https://s3.amazonaws.com/
curl -vv --insecure-aws https://s3.amazonaws.com/</xmp>
</blockquote>
If the first fails and the second
succeeds, you should fix your system's certificates.  Or you can use
the --insecure-aws option.
<p>
Things to do:
<ul>
<li>The XML output is converted to a tabular format.  This code is
small but doesn't give me exactly what I want.  (In fact, I'm not even sure how it works anymore!)  Do I replace it with
something substantially more complicated?</li>
<li>add support for remaining commands and options</li>
</ul>
<p>
HMAC and SHA1 functions have been included, so that no perl modules
need be installed.  The SHA1 function has not been thoroughly tested
and might fail under certain circumstances.  (It has been tested on
x86 and x86/64, but there are many other possibilities.)
<p>
If SHA1 fails, use Digest::SHA1 or Digest::SHA::PurePerl instead.  Use
CPAN to install one, uncomment the relevant "use" statement, and
remove the included sha1() function.
<p>
aws supports streaming, even if Amazon S3 does not.  The following
incredibly useful command would work if Amazon were to add streaming
support:
<blockquote><tt>tar czf . - |s3put timkay/backup.tgz -</tt></blockquote>
