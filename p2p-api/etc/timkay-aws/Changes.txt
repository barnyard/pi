To Do:
	* pass sensitive data to curl via File::Temp::tempfile()

Notes:
	* note the difference between
		aws put --public s3.timkay.com/tim2.jpg tim.jpg
	  and
		aws put --public s3.timkay.com/tim2.jpg
	  In the first case, it should upload tim.jpg, named as tim2.jpg, and set the
	  acl to public-read.  In the second case, should it add ?acl to the target to
	  change the acl, or should it read a new file from stdin?  In other words, is
	  it a change-acl or a put-stdin-with-acl?  I have decided that it means the
	  latter, so I no longer add ?acl automatically.

Future changes will be tracked there.

	* exit with curl exit code when --fail on failure, so it can be scripted better
	* exit code if md5 fails when --fail

aws-1.25 2009-01-11
	* support PUT from STDIN via File::Temp
	* add --cmd0 to use command-line command even when aws was run via a symlink,

	* removed default for CidrIp (0.0.0.0/0)

aws-1.24 2009-01-02

	  curl refuses to upload an empty file from /dev/null)
	* improved processing of output from copy
	* added --simple output for "aws run"

	* add describe-regions
	* add --region=eu (or us, eu-west-1, us-east-1)

	* for addkey, output just the new key, so it can be redirected into the key file
	* for get-console-output, display just the output
	* make Time::Local optional (it is missing on some systems), possibly disabling
	  clock skew sanity check
	* make --request and --expire-time (output signed request but don't issue it)
	  work for EC2 too
	* added test for --install to see that old /usr/bin/aws was successfully removed

aws-1.21 2008-10-24, 2008-11-10

	* added -l, -t, -r, --simple (e.g., "aws ls -l test681")
	* allow - parameters to be combined (e.g., "-ltr")
	* applied same ls options to bucket listings (e.g., "aws ls -l")
	* fixed sha1_sha1, which was setting $t globally
	* disable sanity check warnings when not a tty
	* updated documentation

	  "aws authorize mygroup -u 12345 -o mygroup" will work
	  (Thanks again, Chanchal James!)

aws-1.13 2008-08-15, 2008-08-17

	* fixed passing headers when operating on buckets
	* automatically add a slash to the bucket name in certain cases
	* add support for virtual hosting-style access, so that buckets

aws-1.9 2008-04-16
	* added URL to timkay.com/aws in header (thanks, Wes!)
	* added register - not tested - reported to work
	* added "run-instances" (and left "run-instance", which is
	  incorrect, for backward compatibility)
	* fixed:  if you add standard headers, not amz- headers, it
	  was adding a blank line to what got signed (thanks to Daniel
	  Mueller)

aws-1.8  2008-03-27
	* change to "2008-02-01" protocol
	* update parsing to allow full-word ec2 parameters through
	* kernel and ramdisk:  added support in "run"
	* availability zones:  added "daz" and support in "run"
	* addresses:  added "allad", "aad", "dad", "disad", "rad"

aws-1.7  2008-03-03
	* added --insecureall to make all requests ignore server auth
	  (--insecure only affects remote signing mode)

aws-1.6  2008-01-17, 2008-02-10
	* added --insecure option, so signing can work with self-signed certificates
	* changed defaults for auth:  -P tcp -s 0.0.0.0/0, so that it matches the
	  getting started guide

aws-1.5  2007-10-31

	  is now supported.  (Thanks, Jeff Koftinoff!)

aws-1.4  2007-10-18
	* added -i and -a to ec2run, to take advantage of new instance
	  types and to default to public addressing, anticipating the
	  going away of direct addressing.
	* fixed headers support, so that you can specify more than one
	  custom header.  (Thanks, Russ Ross!)

aws-1.3  2007-10-02

aws-1.2
	* made it work on 64-bit systems by adding "& 0xffffffff"

aws-1.1
	* Added ability to specify x-amz- headers to S3, so that
	  uploads can be made publicly readable, etc.  (Thanks,
	  Etienne James Pollard!)
	* Enhanced --sign option to use it to specify the string to be
	  signed.  This way, the wrapper can read the content, make
	  decsions about what is allowed, and then pass the content on
	  to aws.
	  	* Fixed a bug in parsing parameters containing \n
	* Added version string to the top of the code.

aws-1.0
	* First release
