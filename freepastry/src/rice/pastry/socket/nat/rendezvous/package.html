1) Maintain a "pilot" connection to each non-natted leafset member
Alice wants to communicate with Nancy (both NATted) using Bob as rendezvous.

openSocket() (tcp)
A->B: connect{Nancy, nonce}
B: 
  if have a pilot to Nancy
    B->N (over pilot) connectTo{Alice via Bob, nonce}
  else
    B->N (route) connectTo{Alice via Bob, nonce}
N->B: accept{Alice, nonce} 
B->N: ack1
N: incomingSocket(Alice)
B->A: ack2
A: success:openSocket(Nancy)

rendezvousLayer.sendMessage() (udp, liveness)
A.rendezvousApp.route(udpmessage, Nancy)
  // see above
N.rendezvousApp.receiveMessage(udpmessage, Alice)
N.rendezvousLayer.messageReceived(udpmessage, alice)



The primitive that RendezvousStrategy provides:
1) Nancy contacts Robert and sends him K
2) Robert routes Alice's request to K
3) Kelly at K contacts back to Robert to either stun or relay
Alice can use this to do several things:
  a) Bootstrap
  b) Reconnect Leafset Member (probably, may need to choose Robert on other side of node)
  c) Determine liveness of Alice with Key K (if a different node responds, then Alice is faulty)
  d) This takes out a piece of non-determinism: the route message can't go faster than the connection to Robert, because that connection happens first.
  e) There is still opportunity to choose other node Bob to rendezvous if the connection takes too long, maybe Robert is censoring.

TODO:
  Make LeafSetSRStrategy only pick Non-NATted nodes.
  Send keepalives on UDP/TCP

  Ignore STUN for the first pass.
  
  RendezvousStrategy<Identifier>:
    Identifier getRendezvousPoint();
  
  /**
   * This method uses some third channel to get the node to connect to the dest.
   */
    requestOpenChannel(Identifier node, Identifier dest); // may need to include some kind of identifier, also some kind of failure notifier

Chain of events:
1) Priority or higher wants a socket/message
2) It gets to the Rendezvous layer
 a) The dest is not natted, open normally.
 b) The dest is natted
   i) Local Node is not natted
    Route message for that node to open directly to me
  ii) Local Node is natted:
    Pick a rendezvous
    Route Message to open to the rendezvous
    Open a connection (socket/STUN) to the rendezvous

    Players:
      Nancy (NATted node),
      Alice (Also NATted),
      Urkel ("Un"-NATted node),
      Robert (Nancy's Rendezvous Point, Un-NATted),
      Bob (A different Rendezvous Point)

Strategy:
  Each NodeHandle has a NATted bit.
  If Urkel wants to open a socket to Nancy:
    Urkel uses NATConnectivityApp to route a ConnectRequest to Nancy's key
    Upon reception of the ConnectRequestMessage, 
      if it matches the local key {
        Open a connection Back
      } else {
        Send back a NodeIsFaultyMessage  
      }
  If Alice wants to connect to Nancy:
    Alice chooses a 1-time RendezvousPoint, opens a Socket to it (and/or adds a STUN Record)
    Alice Routes the ConnectionRequestMessage to Nancy, containing the RendezvousPoint
    Upon reception of the ConnectRequestMessage, 
      if it matches the local key {
        Open a connection to the RendezvousPoint (and STUN if possible)
      } else {
        Send back a NodeIsFaultyMessage  
      }
    


This layer maintains temporary information in the NodeHandle for rendezvous nodes.  
Whenever a NodeHandle is deserialized it may contain more current rendezvous information, 
and the call to coalesce() will update this info in the coalesced() NodeHandle.  Note that
the rendezvous list includes a timestamp, and should eventually be signed by the Node.

Extend SRM to use SRStrategy for connecting direct as well. (So can always use the rendezvous if Natted)

Build Planetlab test to simulate NATs 

Don't join if you can't get a rendezvous server.

Invariants:
  A NATted node has a rendezvous server (or kills self)
  A node can send/receive leases,route messages to its direct neightbors
  You have a Certificate for any node in your Routing State  

Notes:
New NAT idea:
  General Strategy:
    Maintain temporary state for rendezvous point for any NATted node that can be used to Source Route, or initiate STUN
    The new Insight: Allow for a circular dependency: Transport depends on Overlay Routing.

  Minimal Overlay Routing assumption: For a node to be in a FreePastry ring, it must be able to communicate with both direct neighbors.

  Vocabulary:
    Players:
      Nancy (NATted node),
      Alice (Also NATted),
      Urkel ("Un"-NATted node),
      Robert (Nancy's Rendezvous Point, Un-NATted),
      Bob (A different Rendezvous Point)

    Rendezvous Point data structure:
      rendezvousNodes: A collection of non-NATted nodes, (including Robert), that the Nancy node will maintain a pilot connection to (This allows Robert to contact Nancy at any time they are both alive.)
      timestamp: (so we know when to replace stale info, always take the newest one)
      signature: (so that the data can't be poisoned)
      validityPeriod: (? may be useful if you build some kind of contract with the rendezvous node)
      certificate: (? necessary to verify the signature, but probably too expensive to include here)

  Q1: How Big is the Rendezvous Point Data Structure?  (Impacts when/how often we send it.)
      // can be small
      a) How many rendezvous points? Each is only 6 Bytes in IPv4, use (1-4 nodes, so 24 bytes)
      b) timestamp 8 bytes
      c) Signature? 160 Bytes
      d) Certificate? Big, probably too big for a MTU, so eliminates use in Liveness Probes

  Q2: How do we discover the Rendezvous Point for a Node? (all or a subset of the following suggestions)
*   a) Shipped with a NodeHandle whenever it is serialized.
      Upon deserialization and coalescing of the NodeHandle the local Rendezvous Point data structure is updated if fresher
      Still need backup strategy to find fresh version if the rendezvous point changes (see following ideas)
*   b) RendezvousPointDiscoveryApp: This _is_ the circular dependency.
      If you can't contact Nancy through the rendezvous point, there are 2 possibilities:
        1) She is faulty
        2) Her rendezvous point changed
      This app can ask for a fresh Rendezvous Point from Nancy by routing a RequestRendezvousPoint message to Nancy.  This message will
        1) Be received by Nancy and she will respond with a fresh Rendezvous Point.
        2) Nancy is faulty, and the new root of the key responds saying so.
        3) Message is dropped, retry.
          #2 seems like a big security risk!  Need Secure Routing?
          How do we know when to use Secure Routing?  The ring size estimate doesn't apply in this situation, because we are talking about the (non-)existence of a single node.  Also, this may occur every time any node changes Rendezvous point, so it's not an especially exceptional case.
    c) store it in Past
       bad: This increases the circular dependency s.t. that Transport depends on Past, only use this as an optimization
    d) Push updates in Scribe
       same problem as Q2.c

  Q3: How does Nancy choose her Rendezvous Point?
*   a) Leafset (scalability problem: may not be enough un-NATted nodes for you to join)
*   b) Trusted Dedicated Node (reliability problem: you depend on that node to always be available)
    c) Discovery (such as an Anycast in Scribe) (new security vulnerability)

  Q4: How does a node communicate with a NATted node(Nancy) now that we have her up-to-date Rendezvous Point (Robert)?
    1) From an un-NATted node (Urkel):
      a) Send a "ConnectRequest" through Robert to Nancy who opens a socket back to Urkel
        As usual Nancy can source route through her LeafSet to avoid Temporary Internet Routing Anomalies.
    2) From a NATted node
      a) Use STUN with Nancy's Rendezvous Point (Robert)
      b) Source route through Robert:
        This is slightly more complicated w/ TCP than usual source routing, because Robert will need to tell Nancy to open a new TCP connection back to him (because Robert can't initiate TCP connections to Nancy, only the other way around.)  We need a new TCP connection for flow control.

Security:
  If we have signatures, we also need to maintain a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), specifically Certificate discovery.  This data is not near as temporal as the Rendezvous Points, but has similar discovery issues.  This is going to be necessary for any security features so it would be nice if we could build a reusable system.

  Q5: When do we need to verify Signatures?
   Whenever we deserialize a NodeHandle that claims to have fresher Rendezvous Point info.  However, there are 2 distinct use cases:
    a) Update to Overlay Routing State.
    b) Other.  (FreePastry Application such as Scribe where NodeHandles are passed in a message)

  Q6: Where do we discover new Certificates?
    a) Centralized, or "3rd channel" solution
      no
    b) Include in Rendezvous Point data structure
      too big to be practical
*   c) Ask the Node who told us of the new NodeHandle
      This can work for Routing State by making an invariant that you keep the Certificate for every node in your Routing State
      This solution doesn't work generally:
        You may not know/be able to contact the node who packaged up the newly discovered NodeHandle:
           intermediate nodes don't always deserialize a RouteMessage
           the message containing the NodeHandle may be encrypted, so intermediate nodes couldn't read it
           data could come from stored data (Such as Past) and the creating node may no longer exist in the network
*   d) Ask the "new" NodeHandle directly
      Do we need to do this?  How important is it to prevent poisoning of "normal" NodeHandles?
      May be expensive, what if his (unverified) Rendezvous Point is stale?
      1) Route for it, similarly to Q2.b?  Since Certificates can't be forged, and aren't temporal, could even be cached
    e) Past
     This is a bad idea for the Routing State, because it puts an additional circular dependency: Transport depends on Routing, which depends on Past (but isn't this argument similar for Q6.c.1?)

// End of Security section

  Q7: How do you bootstrap?
    You don't have a LeafSet, so you don't have a Rendezvous Point.
    a) Temporarily use the Bootstrap as the Rendezvous Point

Other notes (problem cases and solutions, but not necessary for discussion)
  Q8: Are there any cases when 2 direct neighbors can't communicate (our assumption is violated)?
    Scenario:
      Alice and Nancy are direct neighbors, NATted, and use the same Rendezvous Point, Bob.  They communicate by source-routing through Bob. Bob fails.
    Nancy finds a new Rendezvous Point, Robert, but how does she notify Alice?
    Alice doesn't know if Nancy failed, or just can't be contacted.
    In a network where most nodes are NATted, you could imagine the whole LeafSet getting into this problem.

    a) Source Route through the LeafSet
      This makes it necessity to maintain connection with more LeafSet members for reliability
      If you can't communicate with any nodes on 1 side of your LeafSet, this is a LeafSet collapse, kill yourself.  Otherwise, a ping will get through and the response will contain Nancy's new Rendezvous Point

    Crazy scenario:
      Alice/Nancy can't use STUN together, but they can use it with the rest of the LeafSet.  When Bob fails, they can get UDP Liveness Checks through the LeafSet, but can't establish new TCP connections?  In this case, need to make sure STUN can handle Source Routing.

    New reasons to kill self:
      Can't find a Rendezvous Point
      Can verify liveness of direct neighbor, but can't get a socket through to establish leases. // this may be useful anyway, such as if your connection is so congested that you can't get valid leases before they expire 
      
      
Hi Jeff,

I think I still do not understand the properties you are trying
to achieve with Q6. I can see two options:

  1) FreePastry guarantees that, whenever a node X has a NodeHandle
     to another node Y, then X also has the certificate for Y

  2) FreePastry guarantees that, whenever a node X has a routing
     table entry to another node Y, then X also has the certificate for Y

Property #1 seems way too strong, since many messages are not signed
(e.g. a PAST GET); there are many situations in which you would just
want to talk to the node that sent a particular route message, regardless
of what the identity of that node was.

Here is a suggestion that achieves property #2:

  1) Each node has a cache of node certificates and a CA certificate.

  2) Whenever a node opens a direct connection to another node,
     it checks whether it has the corresponding certificate in the cache.
     If not, it asks the other node for it. Then it challenges the other
     node to make sure it has the matching private key.

  3) Node handles are (nodeID,epoch,seq#,{routes},signature). If a node
     handle is deserialized, we check whether we have the certificate.
     If we do, we check the signature; if we don't, we keep the handle
     around nevertheless. Our singleton handle is updated a) if the
     existing handle does not have a valid signature, or b) if both the
     existing and the new handle have a valid signature but the new
     handle has a higher epoch, or the same epoch but a higher sequence number.

  4) The 'identity layer' exports a primitive requestCertificate(peer, nodeID).
     If we already have the certificate for nodeID, the method does nothing.
     If we don't have the certificate, it requests the certificate from 'peer'.
     There is also a haveCertificate(nodeID).

  5) Whenever the routing table gets an update from a peer, it calls
     haveCertificate() for each nodeID, and it inserts only those entries
     for which the method returns true. For the others, it calls
     requestCertficate(peer, ...) and inserts the entries only after
     that method succeeds.

This achieves two things: First, the routing table contains only entries
for which we have the certificate, and for which the node handle signature
checked out okay. Second, routed messages (e.g. PAST GET) work without
checking for certificates at intermediate hops. The destination may get
a node handle without being able to check the signature, but when it opens
a direct channel to send the response, it will obtain the certificate
and the channel is still authenticated.

Applications that do not care about signatures will profit automatically
(because all direct connections are authenticated). If an application does
care about signatures, it can have its own key distribution mechanism
and/or use the provided requestCertificate() method.

Please let me know what you think.

Thanks,

             - Andreas
