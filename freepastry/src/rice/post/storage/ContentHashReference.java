 * and keys, with each stored in ContentHash form.  This is to allow
 * very large objects to be transparently broken up into a group of
 * smaller objects, and each fragment is stored seperately. Note that
 * a readObject() method has been defined to support the automatic
 * migration of old-style references to the new style.
