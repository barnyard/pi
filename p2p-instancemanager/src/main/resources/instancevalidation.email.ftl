<h1>PI Instance validation</h1>

<p>In order to reduce our costs and continue to be able to offer the free service we routinely recover any instances that are no longer in 
use. To identify these we ask the instance owners to indicate that they are still in use by validating them periodically.  At least one of your 
instances is due for validation, and these can be identified by following the link provided in this email. If you no longer intend to use the instance(s) 
you need take no further action, we will take care of that. 
If you do still need them than please take the provided link and check the appropriate boxes in the simple form you will find there. It will take you no more than a few moments.</p>

<p>Please note that there will be no further reminders.  Unless you validate them instances will be paused and then deleted.</p>

<p>Thank you for your use of the service.</p>
